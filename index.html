        <ul>
            <li><em>10/15/25</em> - After working on a programattically created cartridge for my <a href="https://professor-arcade.life">professor arcade site</a> for a bit, I realized I needed to stop with trying to design it while it I was also working on the JS to automatically create each cartridge on upload. Thus, this site was born. I figured this is a great way to practice my CSS skills and also prepare templates that I can use later.</li>
            <li><em>10/16/25</em> - Got the basic outline completed. First, I started with a print out of a real nes cartridge that I put on a graph white board to map out the fr. This worked extremely well. <br> As I got the basic structure of the grid coded into css, it was looking super wonky. It was then I realized I was using <code>grid-area</code> talking frs instead of lines. Once I realized I needed to talk lines, I fixed a bit of it and gave up with hope.</li>
            <li><em>10/17/25</em> - Today, I was able to get dang near the whole thing implemented! Mapping it out on the whiteboard made a transformational difference. I was able to continually reference it in very useful ways.</li>
            <li><em>10/20/25 <strong>to do</strong></em> - Add stripped portion down <code>grip.</code></li>
        </ul>
